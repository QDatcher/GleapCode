## Description

This is a prototype that uses the Tampermonkey and Stylus browser extensions to overlay a faux browser extension on Amazon (specifically when a user searches toilet papers). This was a project done during the course of AKQA's Future Academy Internship for 2023.

## Usage

To use this you need to have both TamperMonkey and Stylus browser extensions. The mainPopup.js and gradePopup.js are sepereate tampermonkey files while the popUp.css is for stylus. The canvas.html was already added in the mainPopup.js file
